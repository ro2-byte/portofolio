            Currently while writing this I am 20 years. <br>
            Studying Information Technology at Kirinyaga University on my 2nd year.<br>
            I have been into tech and computer stuff since I was a kid,
            then in class 6 I moved to a school that had computer lessons and that really pushed me into loving computers more.<br>
            I love coding and building stuff that can help people in their daily lives.
